lab1b-server.c: source code for the project that creates a character-at-a-time, no-echo mode terminal interface and also socket routing that creates a server that listens for client connections and client requests. The server listens for compressed data from the server, decompresses that data, and sends it to a child shell which returns an output. The server then takes that data, compresses it and sends it back to the client.
